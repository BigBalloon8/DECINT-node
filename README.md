# DECINT (decentralized intelligence)

DECINT is the newest innovation in AI. Think of DECINT as a Google Colab alternative.

We take the GPU powered used in PoW crypto mining and give it to the people. Using our custom Neural Network library you can train your models on other peoples gpus for free
via people mining our cryptocurrency. Their CPUs are running a low demanding PoS algorithm whilst their GPUs are running the neural nets.

The miners are rewarded via the crypto made through transaction fees thus the product is funded by the people.
