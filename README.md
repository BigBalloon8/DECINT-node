# DECINT (decentralized intelligence)

DECINT is the newest innovation in AI. Think of DECINT as a Google Colab alternative.

We take the GPU powered used in PoW cryptocurrency mining and give it to the people. You can train your models on other peoples gpus for free
via people mining our cryptocurrency. Their CPUs are running a low demanding PoS algorithm whilst their GPUs are running your neural nets.

The miners are rewarded via the crypto made through transaction fees thus the product is funded by the people.
